<p><h3>Barcelona</h3>
  Barcelona was an amazing city! I got to spend about 3 entire weeks
  here and completely fell in love.
</p>

<p><h3>Stockholm</h3>
  I was able to get a tattoo here by Jack Anckerson who is the owner
  of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nothing-Tattoo/555855664596976" alt="" > Nothing Tattoos! </a href>
</p>

<p><h3>Madrid</h3>
  I got another tattoo here by Barbara Jimenez. I also got to Visited
  the Royal Palace & have a panoramic view of the city.
</p>

<p><h3>Lisbon</h3>
  Visited the famous Pasteis de Belem! Also visited a wonderful restaraunt
  called <i>Ponto Final</i> just on the other side of the bridge. An amazing
  view and a nice dinner, however; a super hard place to find! Unfortunately
  their restaraunt doesn't have a website.
</p>

<p><h3>Rome</h3>
  Obviously got to visit the Roman Forum!
</p>

<p><h3>Amsterdam</h3>
  What was supposed to be a 24hr trip turned into a 16hr trip,
  but still got to visit the Anne Frank House & do the
  Heineken Experience!
</p>

<p><h3>Paris</h3>
  My boyfriend had never been to Paris before, so naturally we
  did the Musee du Louvre & the Eiffel Tower!
